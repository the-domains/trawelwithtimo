Sueno Deluxe Belek

I have an
11-year-old son. During the last decade I've experienced almost 15
family-oriented hotels and resorts. I'm always looking for good quality. Most of
the hotels and resorts have been really nice, but something has always been
missing. If the resort had been designed to please kids, the quality of food
has been lousy. If the hotel has been posh and it's service top-notch, there's
been an unvoiced feeling that kids running around screaming is an adverse
factor. If everything has been perfect, my wallet has been screaming in terror.
So, I thought, the perfect family resort in the perfect environment, at a price
possible for a normal working dad just doesn't exist.

Then I
found Sueno Hotel Deluxe Belek. It's a brand new, huge resort in Turkey. When I
saw the first images on the Internet, I immediately realized -- this is it! The place that could be the best family resort in the whole
world! That's a lot to say, but Sueno Hotel Deluxe Belek has an exceptional
combination of things that make for a successful family holiday.

Kids change everything

Travelling
with kids is different than travelling without them. There are blogs and
articles where a writer tries to prove that you can do all the things you did
on your holiday before kids. But you can't. Kids have different needs than yours,
and as a parent, you are concerned about things you didn't even know existed in
your kid-free life. It's not a good idea to go outside and start searching for
a nice-looking little restaurant if your kid is hungry. You can't dismiss the
discomforts of the hotel if you stay there a lot. If the advertised hotel price
includes just the room and breakfast, there are the many hidden costs you can't
avoid. Kids love to play in a middle of construction work, but that's not any
form of relaxation for adults. So many distracting outside conditions that the
holiday itself can add stress to your life.

Everything for everybody

Sueno Hotel
Deluxe Belek is designed to tackle all of these limitations. Yes, all of them.
All...Of...Them. It features an all-inclusive scheme, which means you don't have to
worry about hidden costs. And you know for sure there's food your offspring is
willing to eat, at the same time you enjoy your gourmet food. And coffee. Ice
cream. Adult beverages for parents. Whatever you like, whenever you like. 

There's
room for everybody. Even the standard rooms are huge. You can spend a week or
two there without having a nervous breakdown. There are all kinds of
entertainment inside the resort. Beach. Pools. Water park. Animation shows.
Indoor amusement park. Cinema. Mini-club. And entertainment for adults, too.
Spa. Beauty centre. Fitness equipment. Night Club. It was so easy to camp next
to poolside for a day and find everything within an easy, short walking
distance. 

My total
favourite was a Food Court. It's an open-air restaurant close to pools, open at
lunch and coffee time. Over 15 different little stalls offering tasty and easy
food, drinks and delicacies. Everybody finds a tasty option, and you can have a
different meal every day. Or eat burgers and fries every day, if you want to.
High quality combined with easy atmosphere and no hassles with money. 

La Dolce Vita

Miss Roza Sansizbaeva, guest relations representative at
Sueno Hotel Deluxe Belek, told me that the main idea of this new resort has
been, and will be, relaxation for the whole family and an easier life -- even for a few days --for their guests. For me,
it's a perfect goal, and I'm sure most families share the feeling.

So, I found the best
family resort in the world. If you know any better family-oriented place
available for a reasonable sum of money, let me know. I'd be more than surprised
if someone could show me a better family resort than Sueno Hotel Deluxe Belek. Until
then, Sueno Hotel Deluxe Belek is my champion in this demanding race.
