# Visit Carlsberg is no ordinary museum

In recent years, I've
learned that museums and exhibitions with themes to which I feel a connection
are much more interesting to me than those that tell stories about ancient
civilisations or art history. Such museums -- like ABBA The Museum and
Spritmuseum in Stockholm, or Rockheim in Trondheim -- are actually really fun
places to visit, and you can easily pass several hours there.

Visit Carlsberg has
been on my Scandi museum bucket list for a while. I was a little worried that I
might have been expecting too much; I hoped that it would not turn out to be just
a collection of glass display cases and a bombastic history of the industrial
giant. I was so relieved to find that the museum in fact showcases an
interesting and varied journey from past to present.

The old Carlsberg brewery,
dating from 1847, has been converted into a modern centre for visitors,
covering 10,000 mÂ². The first building, which is part of the exhibition area,
has a massive collection of unopened beer bottles from around the world
upstairs. In the courtyard, there's a sculpture garden where you can find a
small replica of the Little Mermaid statue that Carl Jacobsen donated
to Copenhagen.

The next building
houses the stables, where you'll find working horses still in residence. I was
lucky to see how two massive Carlsberg horses being prepared for their work as company
ambassadors. The tour ends in the bar, where your admission ticket will allow
you two drinks! Considering the price of alcohol in Copenhagen, the admission
price at the Visit Carlsberg is great value for money.

If you are visiting Copenhagen, I highly
recommend that you spend a few hours at Visit Carlsberg. There's a free shuttle
bus from the city, but if the weather is good, the walk through hipster-populated
Vesterbro is very entertaining in itself.
