# Parola Tank Museum raises up questions

My 12-year-old
son is extremely interested in war vehicles. For him, it's mostly curiosity about
the technical details and playing a load of internet games. However, the
brutality of war and all the killing is always present there too. We have
talked about how different Internet games are to real war and I guess he knows
that. However, I still thought it would be very useful for him to see real
tanks that were used during real wars. I thought, he would discover some new insights
about war technology and maybe even he might think a bit about the misery and
grief that those machines cause in real war situations. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aaff1a92-8e56-4200-97c1-9a9948274b8b.jpg)

So we drove
to Hämeenlinna, where an excellent tank museum, The Parola Tank Museum, is
located. It is a military historical museum with the main task being to gather,
save, investigate and exhibit the history of the Finnish armoured and anti-tank
defence troops. A central theme, furthermore, is to inform visitors about the
use and technical development of the armoured fighting vehicles in the Army of
independent Finland, beginning with the first Renault F.T. Modèle 1917 tanks,
bought in 1919\.

The Tank
Museum also pays honours to Finnish soldiers. It offers a historical display of
the skills and successes of the Finnish armoured troops - especially of the
wartime tank division - against superior enemy forces in Finland's last wars.

On the
sunny summer's day we visited, those vehicles were just historical remains --
but it's easy to understand how terrible the war was for soldiers and civilians
alike. I highly recommend The Parola Tank Museum for everybody -- it's a real
eye-opener for kids who normally just see tanks and war through the medium of Internet
games, as well as for adults, who may try never to think about the brutality of
war.
